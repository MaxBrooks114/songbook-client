# SongBook

Welcome to SongBook. SongBook is a musical library tracking web app, built for musicians to organize their song library, instrument collection and overall progress.

## Features

### Songs

#### Add your own or import from Spotify

Use a form to add a song. This way of adding songs is most useful for your original music. You can add additional details for your song including key, mode, tempo, lyrics and your own album artwork! Alternatively, you can import any song from Spotify by typing a query into the search bar above. Importing a song will give you access to specific metrics from Spotify’s own database, which are then used to discover trends in the music you like –but more on that later. Another great feature of importing from Spotify is that the song is automatically segmented into sections for you.

### Sections

#### The building blocks of music

In music, a section is defined as a complete, but not independent, musical idea. Examples of sections include verse, chorus, bridge, solo etc. SongBook helps to organize and catalogue those various sections that you as a musician either write or learn. For every song you add, you can add any number of sections and the information for that section such as the key, mode, tempo, start, duration, lyrics, etc. SongBook also gives you access to useful tools such as a metronome, an audio recorder, the ability to upload sheet music ortabs and more!

### Instruments

#### Tools of the Trade

As an optional feature of SongBook, you can add any instrument imaginable to your page and link it to any of your sections. This feature is perfect for multi-instrumentalists who know a section or song on more than one instrument. When viewing an instrument, you can see a list of all the songs and sections you know on that specific instrument.

### StatisticsUncover

#### Trends In your own Tastes

SongBook keeps track of all the music you add and aggregates that data to tell you more about your musical tastes, as well as track your progress. Everything from how many songs you have added to a list of your favorite artists can be found in your profile section of SongBook. Furthermore, every song imported from Spotify has the following audio metrics: Valence, Energy, Acousticness, Danceability, Instrumentalness, Speechiness and Loudness among others. SongBook tracks your preferences for those too to see what kind of music you prefer to play.

### Deeper Integration with Spotify

#### (Spotify Premium members only)

If you have Spotify premium you can give SongBook access to your Spotify player. You can do this by hitting the “Integrate Spotify” button found on the filter drawer on the list pages or the manage account page. Once you do this you will see play buttons on every song or section you imported through Spotify. This is especially useful for playing along with songs and sections when learning covers.

## Issues

- It is pretty slow right now. I need to speed it up.

- Songs imported from Spotify may have incorrect data. It can be manually corrected.

- Sections imported from Spotify may also have wrong information, and will not be named verse/chorus etc. Again this can be manually corrected.

## Future Additions

- setlist feature
- duplicate song validation
- tab creator/ importer (songster?)
- spleeter which seperates sound from lyrics
- Spotify playlist bulk import
- user dashboard
